# Task 7: Feature Optimization using RFE

## Project Goal
Enhance classification model performance by selecting optimal features using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

## Objectives
- Use preprocessed Titanic dataset
- Apply RFE with Logistic Regression or Decision Tree
- Select optimal subset of features
- Train baseline and RFE-optimized models
- Compare performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
- Optimal features selected
- Model performance comparison
- Insights on feature importance and model simplification
