# Task 8: Simple Neural Network (MNIST)

## Project Goal
Train a feed-forward neural network on MNIST dataset and compare ReLU vs Sigmoid activations.

## Objectives
- Load MNIST dataset
- Normalize and reshape images
- One-hot encode labels
- Build and train two networks (ReLU and Sigmoid)
- Plot training & validation accuracy/loss
- Compare performance of both models

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Outcome
- Trained ReLU and Sigmoid models
- Accuracy & loss curves visualized
- Comparative analysis of activation functions
