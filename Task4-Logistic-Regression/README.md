# Task 4: Logistic Regression for Titanic Survival

## Project Goal
Build a logistic regression classifier to predict survival on the Titanic dataset.

## Objectives
- Use preprocessed Titanic dataset
- Train logistic regression model
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Analyze model performance

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
- Logistic regression model trained and evaluated
- Classification metrics reported
- Model ready for comparison with other classifiers
