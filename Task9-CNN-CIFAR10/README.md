# Task 9: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – CIFAR-10

## Project Goal
Design and train a CNN for multi-class image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset with data augmentation and feature map visualization.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess CIFAR-10 dataset
- Design CNN with Conv2D, Pooling, Flatten, Dense layers
- Implement data augmentation (rotation, shifts, flips)
- Train and evaluate model
- Visualize feature maps from intermediate layers

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib, OpenCV/Pillow

## Outcome
- Trained CNN with augmented data
- Training/validation curves plotted
- Feature maps visualized
- Model performance insights provided
